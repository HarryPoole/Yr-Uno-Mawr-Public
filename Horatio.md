[[Horatio]] is not merely a god of battle, but of conflict itself, wars between nations, feuds between families, and even internal struggle.

Worshippers of [[Horatio]] believe war is inevitable and necessary, a crucible through which progress is forged. His followers often claim [[Horatio]] does not cause war, only ensures it ends decisively

[[Horatio]]’s temples are often indistinguishable from fortresses.

It is widely believed that [[Horatio]] and [[Hendrik]] were twin brothers, born at the same moment, forged from the same divine intent. Where [[Hendrik]] embodied order, structure, and permanence, [[Horatio]] embodied conflict, change, and decisive force. Their names are similar by design, a reminder that they were never meant to exist apart.

Ancient texts describe them as constantly arguing, not out of hatred, but necessity. [[Hendrik]] would impose law. [[Horatio]] would test them through war and rebellion. Together, they were said to keep reality stable, order without stagnation, conflict without collapse.

Many myths claim that war only existed because order existed first, and that order only endured because war enforced it.
