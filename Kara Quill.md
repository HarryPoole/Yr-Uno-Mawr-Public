[[Kara Quill]] is a representative of [[Acquisitions Incorporated]]. She is well-dressed, calm, and observant, standing out sharply against the general tension of [[Phandalin]].

She reads a peculiar newspaper, The Everlasting Enchantment, whose articles seem to rewrite themselves as events unfold. Kara treats this as completely normal. She has shown interest in the party’s potential, offering future employment with [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] almost casually, as if expecting them to accept eventually.
