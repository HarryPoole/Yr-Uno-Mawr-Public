[[Azazel]] is the God of Death, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

[[Azazel]] is believed to oversee the inflow of souls into the afterlife, guiding them from the mortal world to wherever they are meant to go. Whether a soul is destined for peace, punishment, rebirth, or something stranger is not his concern. His role is transition, not judgment.

Funeral rites often invoke [[Azazel]] to ensure a smooth crossing. He is not feared, but respected, and rarely worshipped beyond moments of loss or danger.

[[Azazel]] does not rule the underworld. He simply delivers souls to their destination, after which his role is complete. Once a soul has crossed the threshold, it no longer belongs to him.
