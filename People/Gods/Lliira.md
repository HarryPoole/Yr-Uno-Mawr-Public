[[Lliira]] is the Goddess of Joy, and a power

Her worship surged centuries ago, when people sought comfort in shared joy, to this day only some historians could tell you why it surged.

Festivals dedicated to [[Lliira]] often arise spontaneously rather than through organised religion. Music, dance, and storytelling are considered sacred acts in her honour.
