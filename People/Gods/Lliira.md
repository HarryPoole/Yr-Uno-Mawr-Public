[[Lliira]] is the Goddess of Joy.

Her worship surged centuries ago, when people sought comfort in shared joy, to this day only some historians could tell you why it surged.

Festivals dedicated to [[Lliira]] often arise spontaneously rather than through organised religion. Music, dance, and storytelling are considered sacred acts in her honour.
