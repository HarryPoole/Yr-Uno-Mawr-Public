[[Lliira]] is the Goddess of Joy, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

Her worship surged centuries ago, when people sought comfort in shared joy, to this day only some historians could tell you why it surged.

In the afterlife, it is said that [[Lliira]] governs the punishments of the underworld. She does not decide who arrives there, only how pain is administered once judgment has already been passed. Her punishments are exact, measured, and never random. Pain ends when its purpose is fulfilled. 

Festivals dedicated to [[Lliira]] often arise spontaneously rather than through organised religion. Music, dance, and storytelling are considered sacred acts in her honour.
