Lliira embodies celebration, laughter, and emotional release. Her worship surged after the Minor Merge, when people sought comfort in shared joy. 

Festivals dedicated to Lliira often arise spontaneously rather than through organized religion. Music, dance, and storytelling are considered sacred acts in her honour. 

Some priests warn that unchecked joy can become denial, a belief that has caused tension with other faiths.
