[[Lliira]] is the Goddess of Joy, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

Her worship surged centuries ago, to this day only some historians could tell you why it surged.

In the afterlife, it is said that [[Lliira]] governs the rewards of worthy and redeemed souls. She does not decide who arrives there, only how joy is bestowed once judgment has already been passed. Her blessings are exact, measured, and never excessive, for excess joy lowers its value. Joy is given with intent, deep and overwhelming, and it endures only as long as its purpose is fulfilled.

Festivals dedicated to [[Lliira]] often arise spontaneously rather than through organised religion. Music, dance, and storytelling are considered sacred acts in her honour.
