[[Giloro]] is the God of Greed, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

[[Giloro]] embodies ambition unchecked. Wealth, hunger, obsession, and want are all considered expressions of his influence. He is not inherently evil, greed can build as easily as it destroys.

Offerings to [[Giloro]] are transactional by nature. Success attributed to [[Giloro]] is often followed by ruin, reinforcing the belief that greed always demands repayment.

Many merchants quietly honour [[Giloro]] while publicly denying it. His temples are rare, but his presence is common.
