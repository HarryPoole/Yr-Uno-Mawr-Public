[[Diovin]] is the God of all Gods, he is believed to stand above the divine hierarchy itself. Most faiths agree that [[Diovin]] does not rule through command, but through existence, that the other gods are reflections, fragments, or consequences of [[Diovin]]’s will.

Very little is known about [[Diovin]]’s direct actions. Temples dedicated solely to [[Diovin]] are rare, and worship is usually symbolic rather than personal. Some believe [[Diovin]] created the framework of reality and then withdrew, allowing the other gods to shape it.

Theologians disagree on whether [[Diovin]] is still active, watching, or entirely absent.

Diovin is believed to be the first will to exist, the force that allowed the gods themselves to emerge. Rather than ruling through command, Diovin maintains balance by allowing the other gods to exist at all. Most faiths agree that Diovin does not intervene directly, and that even prayers addressed to them often go unanswered.

It is commonly taught that Diovin does not act because action would shatter reality. The Great Merge is sometimes interpreted as the closest Diovin has ever come to interference — whether intentional or accidental is a matter of debate.

Diovin is rarely worshipped openly. To acknowledge Diovin is to acknowledge how small everything else is.
