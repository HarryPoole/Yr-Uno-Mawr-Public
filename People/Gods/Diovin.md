[[Diovin]] is the God of all Gods, he is believed to stand above the divine hierarchy itself. Most faiths agree that [[Diovin]] does not rule through command, but through existence, that the other gods are extensions of [[Diovin]]’s will.

Very little is known about [[Diovin]]’s direct actions. Temples dedicated solely to [[Diovin]] are rare, and worship is usually symbolic rather than personal. Some believe [[Diovin]] created the framework of reality and then withdrew, allowing the other gods to shape it.

Theologians disagree on whether [[Diovin]] is still active, watching, or entirely absent.
