[[Diovin]] is the God of all Gods, and the leader of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

Diovin is not worshipped in the same way as other gods. Instead, Diovin is acknowledged. He is believed to have shaped the pantheon itself, setting the boundaries by which gods may act, rule, and conflict.

Unlike other deities, Diovin is rarely associated with intervention. His role is balance at the highest scale — ensuring no god becomes absolute, and no domain consumes all others.

Many theologians claim Diovin does not rule over the gods, but contains them.

“The gods act. Diovin allows.”
