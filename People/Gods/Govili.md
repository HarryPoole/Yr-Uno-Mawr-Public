[[Govili]] is the God of Goodwill, and a powerful figure in the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

[[Govili]] represents cooperation without obligation, the act of giving because it is right, not because it is required. Merchants, diplomats, and rulers often invoke his name when forging alliances or opening trade.

He is said to smile upon peaceful growth and mutual benefit, but to turn away from greed disguised as kindness.

[[Govili]] is often depicted with open hands, never holding wealth himself.
