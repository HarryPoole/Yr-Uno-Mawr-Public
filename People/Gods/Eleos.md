[[Eleos]] is the God of Empathy, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

[[Eleos]] governs the ability to feel the suffering of others without sharing their pain. He is associated with mediation, forgiveness, and the restraint of violence. His temples often serve as neutral ground in disputes.

Clerics of [[Eleos]] are taught to listen first and act second. Empathy, to [[Eleos]], is not weakness, it is the knowledge required to act justly.
