[[Hendrik]] is the God of order, law, and the predictability of the universe. Calendars, contracts, and natural cycles were believed to fall under [[Hendrik]]’s domain.

It is widely believed that [[Horatio]] and [[Hendrik]] were twin brothers, born at the same moment, forged from the same divine intent. Where [[Hendrik]] embodied order, structure, and permanence, Horatio embodied conflict, change, and decisive force. Their names are similar by design, a reminder that they were never meant to exist apart.

Ancient texts describe them as constantly arguing — not out of hatred, but necessity. Hendrik would impose law, boundaries, and cycles; Horatio would test those boundaries through war, rebellion, and pressure. Together, they were said to keep reality stable: order without stagnation, conflict without collapse.

Many myths claim that war only existed because order existed first, and that order only endured because war enforced it.

“When the twins agreed, the world held steady. When they argued, the world moved forward.”
