[[Hendrik]] is the God of Order, and an important important 

It is widely believed that [[Horatio]] and [[Hendrik]] were twin brothers, born at the same moment, forged from the same divine intent. Where [[Hendrik]] embodied order, structure, and permanence, [[Horatio]] embodied conflict, change, and decisive force.

They are always arguing, not out of hatred, but necessity. [[Hendrik]] would impose law, boundaries, and cycles. [[Horatio]] would oppose them. Together, they were said to keep reality stable, order without stagnation, conflict without collapse.

Many myths claim that war only existed because order existed first, and that order only endured because war enforced it.
