[[Horatio]] is the God of War, and a powerful figure in the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

Horatio exists not to destroy order, but to test it. War, to [[Horatio]], is not cruelty, it is pressure. A force that reveals weakness, forces change, and prevents stagnation.

It is widely believed that [[Horatio]] and [[Hendrik]] were twin brothers, born at the same moment, forged from the same divine intent. Where [[Hendrik]] embodied order, structure, and permanence, [[Horatio]] embodied conflict, change, and decisive force.

They are always arguing, not out of hatred, but necessity. [[Hendrik]] would impose law. [[Horatio]] would test them through war and rebellion. Together, they were said to keep reality stable, order without stagnation, conflict without collapse.
