[[Chauntea]] is the Goddess of Agriculture.

She is most commonly worshipped in rural communities. Her worship is practical rather than grand. Farmers pray to her for good harvests, townsfolk for stability, and travelers for safe passage through settled lands. Shrines to [[Chauntea]] are often simple and maintained by the community rather than clergy.

[[Chauntea]] is not associated with miracles or dramatic divine intervention. Instead, she is seen as a steady presence a reassurance that effort matters and that life continues, even when times are hard.
