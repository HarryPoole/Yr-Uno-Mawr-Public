[[Chauntea]] is the Goddess of Agriculture, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]]

Her worship is practical rather than grand. Farmers pray to her for good harvests, townsfolk for stability, and travelers for safe passage through settled lands. Shrines to [[Chauntea]] are often simple and maintained by the community rather than clergy but rare and only found in the southern regions.

[[Chauntea]] is not associated with miracles or dramatic divine intervention. Instead, she is seen as a steady presence a reassurance that effort matters and that life continues, even when times are hard.
