[[Ennil]] is the Goddess of the Living, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

Ennil governs life as it is actively lived. He is commonly honoured by healers, travelers, and adventurers, often without formal prayer. Simply surviving against odds is seen as acting in Ennil’s name.

Ennil is present in quiet moments rather than miracles: the feeling of waking up after an illness, the strength to keep walking, the heartbeat that refuses to stop. He is not prayed to for long life, but for another day.
