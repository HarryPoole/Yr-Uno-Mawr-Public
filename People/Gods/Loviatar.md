[[Loviatar]] is the Goddess of Pain, and a member of the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

Her worship surged centuries ago, to this day only some historians could tell you why it surged.

[[Loviatar]] represents pain as truth. Her followers believe suffering strips away illusion and reveals the self beneath. A soul learns through consequence, because of this, [[Loviatar]] is not universally hated, though she is rarely loved. Shrines to her are quiet places, often found near courts, prisons, or healing halls, where pain is acknowledged rather than denied.

In the afterlife, it is said that [[Loviatar]] governs the punishments of the underworld. She does not decide who arrives there, only how pain is administered once judgment has already been passed. Her punishments are exact, measured, and never random. Pain ends when its purpose is fulfilled.
