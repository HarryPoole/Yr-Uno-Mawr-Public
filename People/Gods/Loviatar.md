[[Loviatar]] is the Goddess of Pain

[[Loviatar]] represents pain as truth. Her followers believe suffering strips away illusion and reveals the self beneath.

She is not widely worshipped, but her influence is undeniable. Healers, interrogators, and ascetics often acknowledge her presence, whether willingly or not.

Among the non-religious, and even among casual worshippers, [[Loviatar]] and [[Azazel]] are often treated as the same god, or at least as different names for the same force. This confusion is widespread enough that most priests no longer bother correcting it unless pressed.
