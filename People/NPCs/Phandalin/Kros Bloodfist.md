First appeared in 

[[Kros Bloodfist]] is a blunt, intimidating man who acts as muscle and messenger for [[Harbin Wester]]. The party knows him as the one who tracked them down at [[Stonehill Inn]] and escorted them to the [[Townmaster’s Hall]]. He doesn’t waste words, doesn’t smile, and clearly prefers action over discussion. Locals seem uneasy around him, but no one argues when he gives an order.
