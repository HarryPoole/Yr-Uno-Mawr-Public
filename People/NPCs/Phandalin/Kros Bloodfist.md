#npc 
*First appeared in [[Session 3]]*

[[Kros Bloodfist]] is a blunt, intimidating man who acts as muscle and messenger for [[Harbin Wester]]. He doesn’t waste words, doesn’t smile, and clearly prefers action over discussion. Locals seem uneasy around him, but no one argues when he gives an order.
