[[Harbin Wester]] is the townmaster of [[Phandalin]], a man who looks like he has not slept properly in weeks. He speaks quickly, wipes sweat from his brow often, and gives the impression of someone constantly trying to stay one step ahead of disaster.

[[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] is clearly overwhelmed by the town’s problems. Goblin attacks, disrupted trade routes, and a general sense of unease have pushed him into relying heavily on outside help. While he insists that things are “under control,” his behaviour suggests otherwise.

[[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] comes across as anxious but genuine. He is eager to hire adventurers, quick to offer payment and lodging, and visibly relieved to pass responsibility to someone more capable than himself.
