#npc 
[[Sharna Quirstiron]] is a trader who operates along the routes between [[Phandalin]] and [[Stonehaven]]. Normally reserved, she has recently taken to heavy drinking at [[Stonehill Inn]].

[[Sharna Quirstiron|Sharna]]’s stress comes from repeated disruptions to trade routes, lost shipments, and growing fear among caravan guards. These losses are clearly personal as well as financial, and she appears deeply unsettled by the lack of safety on the roads.
