The character played by Zoe
First appeared in [[Session 1]]
# Description
[[Phantom]] has olive skin and messy black hair that poofs out from the top of their head. However, their face is usually obscured by the upturned collar of their white button-up. laid on top is a scruffy tie, orange jumper, a yellow scarf that runs down to the floor, and a terribly oversized open trench coat. In their left hand, they near-permanently have a briefcase - the two are practically inseparable.
