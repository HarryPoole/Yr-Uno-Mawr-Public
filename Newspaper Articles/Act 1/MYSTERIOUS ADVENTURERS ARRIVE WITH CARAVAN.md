_Phandalin Local Sheet_

Late yesterday evening, a small group of armed travellers arrived in [[Phandalin]] alongside a battered trade caravan, marking the first successful escorted arrival in several weeks.

Eyewitnesses claim the group intervened during a goblin ambush along the eastern road, driving the attackers off and ensuring the caravan’s safe passage into town. Details remain unclear, with accounts varying wildly regarding the number of goblins involved and the nature of the fight.

“They didn’t look like much at first,” said one onlooker, “but anyone who walks in from the road these days is either very brave or very dangerous.”

Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]] declined to comment on whether the group had been officially hired, but confirmed that “capable adventurers are always welcome in [[Phandalin]].”
