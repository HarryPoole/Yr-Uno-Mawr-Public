_Religious Observance Notice_

With the Leap Month approaching, temples across [[Cyfand]] have begun preparations for extended rites, offerings, and periods of heightened observance.

Clerics warn that [[Calendar System|Salium]] has historically been associated with instability, both divine and mortal, and encourage citizens to avoid major decisions during this time.

Followers of [[Salto]] describe the month as “necessary, dangerous, and forgiven in hindsight.”

Most temples stress that nothing _bad_ is expected, only that vigilance is wise.
