The ruined city east of [[Phandalin]], identified in fragmented records as Neverwinter, remains uninhabited centuries after its sudden abandonment.

Attempts to resettle the area have repeatedly failed, with settlers citing unease, strange sounds, and buildings that “do not behave as expected.” No official cause for the city’s fall has ever been recorded.
