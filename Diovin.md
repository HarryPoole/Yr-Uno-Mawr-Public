[[Diovin]] is the God of all Gods, lieved to stand above the divine hierarchy itself. Most faiths agree that Diovin does not rule through command, but through existence — that the other gods are reflections, fragments, or consequences of Diovin’s will.

Very little is known about [[Diovin]]’s direct actions. Temples dedicated solely to Diovin are rare, and worship is usually symbolic rather than personal. Some believe Diovin created the framework of reality and then withdrew, allowing the other gods to shape it.

Theologians disagree on whether Diovin is still active, watching, or entirely absent.
