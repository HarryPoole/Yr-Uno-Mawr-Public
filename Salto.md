[[Salto]] is the God of the Leap Month, and a lesser figure in the [[Pantheon of Gods]].

During the leap month of the calendar, [[Salto]] is believed to surpass even [[Diovin]] in power. This authority is temporary and often goes to his head, according to myth, but is always forgiven once the month ends.
