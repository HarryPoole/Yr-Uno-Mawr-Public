[[Govili]] represents generosity, mercy, and cooperation between people. Unlike many gods, [[Govili]]’s influence is subtle and often attributed to human nature rather than divine action.

Shrines to Govili are common in towns that rely on mutual aid. Acts done “in Govili’s name” are often anonymous, reinforcing the belief that goodwill loses meaning when it seeks recognition.

Some theologians argue Govili’s power waxes and wanes depending on mortal behavior, making them unusually dependent on the world they influence.
