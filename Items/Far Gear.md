A component of the Orrery of the Wanderer associated with distance, separation, and unreachable places. 

The [[Far Gear]] governs the magical features of the [[Orrery of the Wanderer]]

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Intimidation checks.

**Aberrant Ally**. You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the [conjure celestial](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2040-conjure-celestial) spell (no concentration required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the [[Far Gear]], it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**Unnatural Bane**. You can cast the [bane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2009-bane) spell (save DC 15), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the [[Far Gear]], it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**Part of a Whole**. While this component is not installed in the [[Orrery of the Wanderer]], its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
