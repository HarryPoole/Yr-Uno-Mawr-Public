#location 
[[Arvum]] is the larger of the two nations that form [[Cyfand]], covering most of the mainland. To most people, [[Arvum]] is [[Cyfand]], it holds the capital, the largest trade routes, and the majority of the population.

Its landscape is broad and varied: long trade roads, fertile farmland, dense forests, and mountain ranges rich with old ruins and exhausted mines. Most settlements are practical rather than grand, built to support trade, agriculture, or travel between major hubs. Power is centralised, with governance flowing outward from [[Arcanport]], though in practice many towns operate with a fair amount of local autonomy.

[[Arvum]] is known for bureaucracy, regulation, and stability. Guilds, councils, and merchant houses wield as much influence as nobles, and nearly everything worth doing requires a permit, a stamp, or at least a witness. Adventurers are common, tolerated, and quietly relied upon to solve problems the state would rather not acknowledge.
