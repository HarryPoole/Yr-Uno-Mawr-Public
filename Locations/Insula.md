[[Insula]] is a rugged island nation to the west, separated from [[Arvum]] by a narrow but treacherous sea. Though politically united with [[Arvum]] under [[Cyfand]], [[Insula]] retains a strong cultural identity and is often treated as an afterthought by mainland officials.

The island is defined by rolling hills, rocky coastlines, dense fogs, and ancient stone structures whose origins are poorly documented. Settlements are smaller and more isolated, with communities built around kinship, oral tradition, and local custom rather than formal law. Temples and old shrines are common, often predating the union itself.

[[Insula]] people are known for their resilience and mistrust of outside authority. While they recognise [[Arcanport]]’s rule in name, enforcement is light, and mainland laws are frequently adapted, or ignored entirely. Magic is spoken of more openly here, treated less as a tool and more as a force to be respected.
