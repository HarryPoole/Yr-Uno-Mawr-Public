[[Stonehaven]] was originally built to house miners and mining operations in the surrounding mountains, it survived the collapse of that industry, due to depletion of ores in the mountains, and became a hub for adventurers, mercenaries, and explorers.

The city openly caters to people willing to take risks. Contracts are common, weapons are easy to acquire, and tales of failed expeditions are shared as often as successful ones. Reputation carries weight, and experience matters more than status.

Stonehaven is considered a reliable place to find work if you are capable — and a dangerous place to stay if you are not. Many who pass through see it as a temporary stop, but some never leave.
