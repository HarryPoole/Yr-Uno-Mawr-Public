#location

[[Arcanport]] is the largest city in [[Cyfand]] and the place where major trade passes through. Ships arrive constantly, bringing goods, people, and ideas from far beyond the local regions.

To most people, [[Arcanport]] is also associated with magic. Arcane guilds, scholars, and institutions operate openly there, magical experimentation is treated as an accepted part of daily life. New spells, devices, and theories are said to originate there before slowly spreading outward.

The city is ruled by councils and officials rather than a single figure, which gives it a reputation for being slow to act but difficult to disrupt. [[Arcanport]] feels distant from urban problems, yet its decisions often affect places far smaller than itself.
