[[Arcanport]] is known as the largest city on the continent of [[Cyfand]] and the place where most major trade eventually passes through. Nearly everything worth buying or selling has passed through its docks at some point. Ships arrive constantly, bringing goods, people, and ideas from far beyond the local regions.

  

To most people, [[Arcanport]] is also associated with magic. Arcane guilds, scholars, and institutions operate openly there, and magical experimentation is treated as an accepted part of daily life. New spells, devices, and theories are said to originate there before slowly spreading outward.

The city is ruled by councils and officials rather than a single figure, which gives it a reputation for being slow to act but difficult to disrupt. [[Arcanport]] feels distant from frontier problems, yet its decisions often affect places far smaller than itself.
