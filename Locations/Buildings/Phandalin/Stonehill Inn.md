#location 
The [[Stonehill Inn]] stands near the centre of [[Phandalin]], its timber frame solid and well-kept despite the town’s rough edges. A warm yellow glow spills from its shuttered windows at all hours of the day.

Inside, the common room is lively but never rowdy. A broad stone fireplace dominates the far wall, its embers crackling softly as locals gather around heavy wooden tables scarred by years of honest use. The floorboards creak underfoot, and the low murmur of conversation is punctuated by the clink of mugs and the occasional burst of laughter. A simple wooden bar runs along one side of the room, behind which shelves of bottles and clay jugs are kept meticulously organized.

The food is hearty and filling rather than fancy—thick stews, roasted root vegetables, and crusty bread served warm. Drinks range from watered-down small beer to stronger ales and spirits brought in by caravan when trade is good.

Upstairs, the inn offers modest but clean rooms. Each contains a sturdy bed, a small washbasin, and a shuttered window looking out over the town. The walls are thin, and guests can often hear the wind outside—or the faint sounds of life continuing below—but the beds are comfortable, and the inn is widely considered the safest place to sleep in Phandalin.

Toblen Stonehill keeps a watchful eye on his guests, and trouble is quietly discouraged. For travelers passing through or adventurers laying low, the Stonehill Inn is a place to rest, recover, and hear the latest rumors drifting through town.
