#location 
[[Stonehill Inn]] stands near the centre of [[Phandalin]], its timber frame solid and well-kept despite the town’s rough edges. A warm yellow glow spills from its shuttered windows at all hours of the day.

Inside, the common room is lively but never rowdy. A broad stone fireplace dominates the far wall, its embers crackling softly as locals gather around heavy wooden tables scarred by years of honest use. The floorboards creak underfoot, and the low murmur of conversation is punctuated by the clink of mugs and the occasional burst of laughter. A simple wooden bar runs along one side of the room, behind which shelves of bottles and clay jugs are kept meticulously organized.

Upstairs, [[Stonehill Inn|the inn]] offers modest but clean rooms. Each contains a sturdy bed, a small washbasin, and a shuttered window looking out over the town. The beds are comfortable, and [[Stonehill Inn|the inn]] is widely considered the safest place to sleep in [[Phandalin]].

[[Toblen Stonehill]] keeps a watchful eye on his guests, so trouble is not possible. For travellers passing through or adventurers laying low, [[Stonehill Inn]] is a place to rest, recover, and hear the latest rumours drifting through town.
