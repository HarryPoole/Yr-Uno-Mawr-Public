First appeared in [[Session 3]]

The [[Townmaster’s Hall]] is a worn wooden building near the centre of [[Phandalin]], serving as the town’s only place of official business. Inside, it’s cluttered with maps, loose papers, and half-finished notices, all centred around a single desk used by [[Harbin Wester]]. It feels less like a seat of power and more like a room desperately trying to keep up with too many problems at once.
