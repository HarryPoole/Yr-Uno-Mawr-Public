*First appeared in [[Session 1]]*

The [[Goblin Caves]] are a network of damp, twisting tunnels carved into the rock beneath the nearby hills. The air inside is stale and thick with the smell of rot, wet stone, and old smoke. Faint scratching and distant echoes make it hard to tell how large the cave system really is.

The walls are coated in thick patches of webbing, some old and grey, others fresh and sticky. Rusted weapons, broken shields, and half-buried bones litter the floors, suggesting that many have entered the caves and not all have left.

Signs of goblin activity are everywhere: crude markings scratched into stone, scattered bedrolls, stolen goods piled without care, and poorly maintained torches that sputter with weak flame. Despite the chaos, the goblins appear to know the caves well, moving quickly through narrow passages and hidden routes.

Several tunnels lead toward the surface, all eventually opening onto the same road toward [[Phandalin]] and [[Stonehaven]].
