#npc 
[[Toblen Stonehill]] is the proprietor of [[Stonehill Inn]] and one of the steadier presences in [[Phandalin]]. Calm, practical, and observant, he keeps the inn running despite the town’s growing anxiety.

Toblen listens far more than he speaks and seems to know most of what happens in town, even if he does not comment on it openly. He is generous with rooms, meals, and conversation, especially toward those who help Phandalin.
