# Overview
The lands of [[Cyfand]] follow a lunar and solar based calendar said to have been set down in the early divine age, when time itself was first measured with any consistency.

A standard year consists of 354 days, divided into twelve months, each alternating between 29 and 30 days. The moon completes a full cycle of phases within each month.

Every nineteen years, the calendar enters a known correction cycle. In the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years of this cycle, an additional month, known as the Leap Month, is inserted to keep the sun aligned. This month is widely associated with instability, divine interference, and rare events, and many people delay major decisions until it has passed.

### **Common Beliefs**

Most people accept the calendar as a practical truth rather than a divine mystery, though temples insist its structure reflects the balance of the gods. The Leap Month is treated with particular caution, contracts may be voided, laws temporarily suspended, and temples remain open far longer than usual.

Even those who do not follow the gods closely tend to agree on one thing:
