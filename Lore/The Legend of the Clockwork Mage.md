A millennia ago, when the planes spun close enough for mortals to touch their edges, there lived a mage known only as [[the Clockwork Mage]]. They believed time and space were mechanisms cogs and gears that could be tuned to perfection.

Their masterpiece was a divine machine capable of bending time and space to anyone’s will. With a single rotation, they could open portals, rewrite seconds, or bind worlds together.

But the device’s power frightened them. They saw the futures it would create: collapsing stars, merging planes, worlds devouring one another. So before their curiosity destroyed existence itself, they shattered the device into several components, scattering them across separate worlds, so they could never reunite.
