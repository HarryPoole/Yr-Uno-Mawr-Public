Spellcasting in D&D is dumb. I mean come on, spells can just be casted out of thin air with the occasional material component? Not in my house it’s not. The real way to cast spells is through [[Runes]].

# Runes
A rune is any 8 pointed shape (not to be confused with an 8 sided shape), depending on the lines connecting these points the runes will do different things, like its range, level, duration, school, etc. 

When a rune is drawn it consumes one of the user’s spell slots, and is not cast until the rune is touched by any magic user that can cast that spell. 

Upon casting the object the rune is placed upon takes 1d2 acid damage and 1d2 fire damage. This destroys any small object

Each spell caster usually carries at most 100, and at least 20 pieces, of square 10cm x 10cm pieces of paper at all times with 8 points on each of them.

A small rune, level 1 or above, takes a normal spellcaster 3 seconds to draw and 3 seconds to cast, allowing a spellcaster to draw and cast a rune in one turn, the spellcaster may also draw 2 runes in a single turn. If a spellcaster has prepared 2 runes, they may cast both in a single turn in combat, a small rune is treated as a ½ turn to cast or draw.

A small cantrip rune takes a normal spellcaster 2 seconds to draw and 4 seconds to cast, allowing a spellcaster to draw and cast a cantrip in a single turn. A spellcaster may draw up to 3 cantrips in a single turn, but they may only cast a single cantrip in one turn. In combat a cantrip is treated as a ⅓ turn to draw and a ⅔ turn to cast.

Once a rune has been cast the rune does not disappear as long as the material it is used upon is not destroyed. If a rune is drawn on a large piece of paper, the piece of paper is still destroyed due to the high flammability of the material, however, if the rune is drawn on another large surface that can withstand the material, they are able to retain the rune for another use, without the cost of another spell slot.
