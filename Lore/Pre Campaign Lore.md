**[[Lottie|The Clockwork Mage]]**
Many millennia ago, when the planes spun close enough for mortals to touch their edges, there lived a mage known only as [[Lottie]], the Clockwork Mage. [[Lottie]] believed time and space were mechanisms cogs and gears that could be tuned to perfection.

Her masterpiece was the [[Orrery of the Wanderer]], a divine machine capable of bending time and space to her will. With a single rotation, she could open portals, rewrite seconds, or bind worlds together.
But [[Orrery of the Wanderer|the Orrery]]’s power frightened her. [[Lottie]] saw the futures it would create: collapsing stars, merging planes, worlds devouring one another. So before her curiosity destroyed existence itself, she shattered [[Orrery of the Wanderer|the Orrery]] into seven components, scattering them across seven separate worlds, so they could never reunite.

**[[The Merge]]**
Over countless centuries, [[Orrery of the Wanderer|the Orrery]]’s own iron will began drawing the fragments back together. When their alignment nears completion, the worlds begin to overlap, converging in a catastrophic event known as [[The Merge|Yr Uno Mawr]], Welsh for “The Great Merge.”

The process can be slowed or hastened by one device: the [[Dimensional Loop]], a control mechanism built to regulate [[Orrery of the Wanderer|the Orrery]]’s reach. Fortunately, this Loop now lies in the pre-Merge world.

**[[The Minor Merge]]**
Centuries ago, when [[Dimensional Loop|the Loop]] was first discovered, a band of adventurers unearthed the [[Dimensional Loop]] deep in [[Stonehaven]]’s mountains. When they activated it, reality folded, creating a small-scale Merge.

A section of another world was pulled into this one including the town of [[Phandalin]], which brought with it a second component: the [[Chronolometer]]. The people of [[Phandalin]] are plagued by dreams of other realms and flashes of the future, echoes of [[The Merge|the full Merge]] still to come.
Some of the adventurers who triggered the event were erased from that world by [[Orrery of the Wanderer|the Orrery]], but the rest of the adventurers stayed and formed a group of monks able to protect the [[Dimensional Loop]].

**The Present Day**
The [[Dimensional Loop]] now lies sealed in a mountain monastery above [[Stonehaven]], tended by an order of monks whose sole purpose is to delay [[The Merge]]. Every generation, they perform rituals to stabilize it, but they cannot stop it, only slow it down. The alignment is inevitable.

The [[Chronolometer]] rests quietly in [[Phandalin]], hidden within the mayor’s home. Each mayor is told only to protect the “heirloom” and never to question it. No one remembers its true name or power.
The two fragments’ presence in one realm ensures this world will be the epicentre when Yr Uno Mawr begins

**The Other Five Fragments**
1. The [[Wheel of Stars]] - buried in an ancient desert temple beyond a sprawling sand-city, surrounded by constellations carved in stone.
2. The [[Far Gear]] - locked away in Prisoner 13’s vault.
3. The [[Timepiece of Travel]] - encased in a village from Wales, known as, [[Llangranog]], its world has the most complicated terrain to explore, yet the effects of the Timepiece allow the inhabitants to easily travel across it.
4. The [[Rotor of Return]] - trapped inside a Bag of Holding lost to history. When [[The Merge]] occurs, this bag becomes its own world, its terrain formed of endless fabric hills and mountains of discarded treasures, the rubbish heap of creation.
5. The [[Orrery Base]] - hidden as a false clock face atop Elizabeth’s Tower in a D&D-style [[London]], anachronistic but eerily untouched by time.

![[Legend of the Merge]]

Most call it myth.
The monks of [[Stonehaven]] call it prophecy.
And the people of [[Phandalin]] call it déjà vu.
