**“Road to Phandalin”**

Setting: The road between the [[Goblin Caves]] and [[Phandalin]]

**Plan:**
Party has just emerged from the [[Goblin Caves]]
*"The air if fresh, a welcome relief after the damp darkness of the cave. A dirt path winds between low hills and sparse trees, In the distance, faint wagon tracks emerge across the dirt road leading toward a cluster of rooftops nestled in a green valley."*

As [[The Party]] travels, they hear shouting and clash of steel; a small caravan is under attack by goblins.
*“The scent of pine drifts through the breeze as you follow the road. The silence is loud, occasionally interrupted by the chirp of a distant bird. After a while, you hear the unmistakable clash of steel and the cries of panic."*

*"You see chaos erupting along the trail, a wagon on its side, a horse bleeding from an arrow wound, and a merchant shouting in desperation as a goblin clings to the back of their cart. Two guards, clearly overwhelmed, try to hold the line as more goblins emerge from the treeline with snarling grins.”*

The travellers are:
	A merchant (wounded, desperate to save their wares).
	A guard or two (barely holding the line). 
	A scholar (carrying letters or trade permits, linking back to Phandalin).

**Combat:** 5x Goblins + 2x **friendly** knights

After the fight, the travellers thank [[The Party]] and share info:
	The goblins have become far more coordinated recently.
	Roads have been unsafe for weeks, even guards are afraid to travel.
	[[Phandalin]]'s council has sent word to [[Stonehaven]] asking for adventurer assistance.
	They believe the party to be the help [[Stonehaven]] sent them.

*“One of the guards bows low, trembling hands put his sword on the floor to lean on. ‘By the gods… if you hadn’t come along…’ The other guard nods in agreement, wiping blood from his cheek as the scholar kneels beside a broken crate, carefully retrieving a few rolled parchments.”*

The travellers invite the party to escort them back to [[Phandalin]], ensuring a safe arrival before nightfall.
*“'You must be the ones Stonehaven sent,’ the merchant says hopefully. ‘Praise the gods, everyone's been holding their breath for weeks. You’ll see soon enough… Please let us guide you back.'”*

“As the road dips into a gentle valley, a modest town comes into view, its wooden rooftops catching the last orange light of day. A weathered sign by the path reads: Welcome to Phandalin.’”
