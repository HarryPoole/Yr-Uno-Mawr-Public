**“Awakening in the Web”**

Setting: [[Goblin Caves]]

**Plan:**
[[The Party]] wakes in Area A, surrounded by the remains of a failed adventuring group.
*"Cold stone presses against your back as you awaken to the plop of dripping water and the faint buzz of flies. As you look around you see strands of thick webbing stretching across the walls and the remains of other adventurers, whose faces stare blankly, their armour and weapons are corroded by rust. A large tunnel in the ceiling catches your eye, you can hear stone tapping coming from within."*

After a while the party encounters an injured giant spider, which came from the ceiling, and they have to fight it off. **Combat:** Injured _Giant Spider_ (HP 15).
*"Suddenly, a faint tremor ripples through the floor and dust falls from the ceiling tunnel, followed by the grotesque shape of a massive spider falling down, one leg is torn, oozing thick black ichor. Its eyes gleam like wet obsidian in the dim light as it screeches."*

Two surprised bandits, called [[Vonnet]] and [[Dilly]] who are injured and exploring the cave to find some loot after fighting the Giant Spider.
*"From the shadows of a narrow passage, torchlight flickers. Two rough-looking figures stumble into view, both bleeding, they seem to be arguing."*

As they explore, they can choose to clear Areas G and H for loot (and to face 5 goblins).
*"You enter the room to see two goblins banging on one of the walls, before noticing you, and they draw out their weapons."* **Combat:** 2 x Goblins.

*"You open the door to see 5 goblins sitting in a circle around a silver bowl holding each other hands and chanting in an arcane language, suddenly, a small flickering spirit emerges from the bowl, red with rage."* **Combat:** Shadow.

During combat 4 of the 5 goblins retreat into the depths of the cave using another hidden passageway through the back of Area H.

All exits ultimately lead to the surface road toward [[Phandalin]], with faint wagon tracks visible.
*"You follow the winding tunnels until the air grows cleaner and cooler. At last, sunlight breaks through, pale and blinding after the cave’s gloom. You emerge onto a rocky trail that winds through sparse forest. In the distance, faint wagon tracks emerge across the dirt road leading toward a cluster of rooftops nestled in a green valley."*
