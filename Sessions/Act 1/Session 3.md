# ”Hunter’s Game”
*23rd of Diozio 1759*

[[Hechy]], [[Phantom]], and [[Cerise]] wake to the town of [[Phandalin]] inside [[Stonehill Inn]]. Downstairs, [[the party]] spots a rune, carved into a wall, being reactivated. They order breakfast and but some newspapers, titled “The Weekly Wizard”, it contains articles about [[ACQUISITIONS INCORPORATED EXPANDS OPERATIONS IN RURAL REGIONS|Acquisitions Incorporated expanding]], [[NEVERWINTER STAYS ABANDONED AFTER ALMOST 400 YEARS|A city called Neverwinter being abandoned]], and [[MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURERS ARRIVE WITH CARAVAN|adventures arriving in Phandalin]]. 

Soon after, an angry man enters [[Stonehill Inn|the building]], asks for the new goblin hunters and introduces himself to the party as [[Kros Bloodfist|Kros]] and directs them to the [[Townmaster’s Hall]] where [[Harbin Wester]] is waiting for them.

Exiting [[Stonehill Inn]], [[Hechy]] looks up to see the same cracks in the sky she saw in her dream, questioning the rest of the party, she finds that no one else can see them. At the [[Townmaster’s Hall]], [[Harbin Wester]] explains that two goblin camps are crippling [[Phandalin]]’s trade, one is hidden in the forests, ambushing travellers, and another built into the mountains overlooking a critical pass. He offers thirty gold pieces each, permission to keep any loot they find, and presents them with a magical wand, in exchange for destroying the camps and their leaders. [[The party]] accepts and chooses to go the mountain camp.

While walking to the camp, the party decides to read some more of their newspaper, they read [[SALIUM APPROACHES - TEMPLES PREPARE|an article about the month of Salium]], [[Hechy]] also notices that the cracks in the sky are beginning to fade.

Once they arrive the party forms a plan for [[Hechy]] to take out the goblin leader and for [[Phantom]] and [[Cerise]] to take out the surrounding goblins.

Once in the goblin leader’s room, [[Hechy]] finds that the leader is a hobgoblin, [[Hechy]] barely survives a single hit from the goblin and starts running. [[Phantom]] teleports into the cave to help [[Hechy]], distracting the hobgoblin from the rest of the goblins. [[Cerise]] and [[Hechy]] try to deal some of the goblins, while [[Phantom]] deals with the hobgoblin leader. 

As soon as the hobgoblin falls the rest of the goblins start to try and run out of the camp but [[the party]] manages to stop them before they leave.

[[Hechy]] decides to heal [[the party]] par himself and they start looting the bodies and the crates, finding a handful of useful items, as well as a dragon scale. [[The party]] decides to go back to [[Phandalin]], they take a quick stop to the [[Townmaster’s Hall]] before going to [[Stonehill Inn]] for dinner. While talking to [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]], the party finds out that [[Phandalin]] has been known to give people dreams about anything from the past to the future with unnerving accuracy.

[[Hechy]] decides to visit the local blacksmith, and buys some chainmail as a loan from [[Cerise]]. [[Cerise]] also orders a custom made shackle and key. [[Hechy]] also tries to sell off the dragon scale she got, but the blacksmith tells her it’s beyond their understanding. [[The party]] leaves and decides to go back to [[Stonehill Inn]] and rest for the night, deciding to continue their quest tomorrow.
