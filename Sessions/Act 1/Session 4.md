# “Hunter’s Remains”
*24th of Diozio 1759*

After waking up, [[the party]] gets breakfast. [[Hechy]] leaves before the others to start scouting the camp but [[Cerise]] and [[Phantom]] leave and catch up to her quite quickly. Once they arrive, they devise a plan for [[Hechy]] to make a distraction by lighting their wall on fire while [[Cerise]] and [[Phantom]] go through the main entrance. [[Hechy]] catches an entire section of the camp on fire, killing some goblins and attracting the rest, while [[Cerise]] and [[Phantom]] take out the other goblins. 

Two goblins riding horses are also attracted to the fire and start putting it out, while taking out the goblins, a horse is taken out in the crossfire and another starts running away, [[Cerise]] starts calming it and eventually tames it. 

[[Cerise]] and [[Phantom]] get on top and run towards the hobgoblin leader, [[Phantom]] does an attack which only hits the horse, while [[Hechy]] runs up and starts attacking the goblins next to the leader. The hobgoblin shoots [[Cerise]] and the horse, causing it to die. [[Cerise]] just cries. [[Phantom]] defeats the remaining goblins and hobgoblin. 

[[Cerise]] gets over her immense loss in about 2 seconds, [[the party]] loots the boxes around the camp and decides to head back to [[Phandalin]].
