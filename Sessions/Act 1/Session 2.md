# “Welcome to Phandalin”
[[The party]] entered [[Phandalin]], the knights led them to the local tavern, [[Stonehill Inn]], said thank you again and left them there. Upon entering, [[the party]] was greeted by [[Harbin Wester]], confusing them for a group of adventurers from [[Stonehaven]], nevertheless, he asks for their help with some troubles [[Phandalin|the town]] has been having, and offers to pay them all handsomely. He also tells them he’ll pay for their room at [[Stonehill Inn]], and leaves, telling them that they’ll discuss the details in the morning.

Following this, [[Hechy]] goes over to the barkeeper, [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] who gives them two rooms and breakfast in the morning. Meanwhile, [[Cerise]] and [[Phantom]] to go outside and chat for a minute, afterwards, they both go inside and get a few drinks that [[Hechy]] had bought them. [[Cerise]] refuses to drink and [[Phantom]] gets really drunk, causing [[Cerise]] to bring her upstairs, but as they do so they are stopped by a woman, she sees them and puts down her newspaper, titled “The Everlasting Enchantment” which has articles being rewritten and added in real time, she tells them their recent mission with the guards were impressive, and questions them on the details, not wanting to talk, [[Cerise]] tells her to go away and [[Cerise]] and [[Phantom]] walk upstairs to their room. The same woman walks over to [[Hechy]], says her name is [[Kara Quill]] and congratulates her, but before she continues, [[Hechy]] tells her she is not who [[Kara Quill|Kara]] thinks she is, [[Kara Quill|Kara]] tells her that it’s a shame since they’ve been doing great, briefly wonders where the real adventurers are, and tells [[Hechy]] that if she ever wants a job with [[Acquisitions Incorporated]], then she should come find her and she’d happily employee her.

[[Hechy]] inquires to[[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] about the very drunk person next to her, he says her name is [[Sharna Quirstiron|Sharna]] and she isn’t usually a drinker but has been drinking a lot with the stress of the interruptions to her trade routes. [[Hechy]] tries to talk to her and manages to get her to go home in her drunken state.

Next, [[Hechy]] talks to [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] who is reading the newspaper, titled “The Destructive Daily” [[Hechy]] asks to read it for a bit, and finds a few articles about the worsening of the [[Stonehaven]] trade routes and about scholars discussing [[The Legend of the Clockwork Mage]], following this, [[Hechy]] decided to go to sleep.

During her dream, she saw everything change into [[Phandalin]], everyone screaming and running away while a huge crack in the sky emerged, with different places seen inside. Everything started to fade, and [[Hechy]] was left with only the rhythmic beating of cracks. [[Hechy]] awoke with a cold sweat.
