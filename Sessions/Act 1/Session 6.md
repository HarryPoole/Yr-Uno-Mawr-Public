# "Ashes of Authority"
*25th of Diozio 1759

[[The party]] continued the court case against [[Cerise]], but [[Phantom]] waited outside. [[Hechy]] and [[Cerise]] did testimonies and they eventually called for a false arrest since [[Kros Bloodfist|Kros]] didn’t read them their rights. [[Cerise]] was let go, and [[Hechy]] decided to talk to [[Kros Bloodfist|Kros]] outside. [[Hechy]] was very angry at [[Kros Bloodfist|Kros]] and lit him on fire and killed him. [[Cerise]] saw this and the noise caused a few people to arrive at the scene, but believed [[Kros Bloodfist|Kros]] to have killed himself as [[Hechy]] was also burnt.
