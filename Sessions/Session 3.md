**“Welcome to Phandalin”**

Setting: [[Phandalin]], early evening

**Plan:**
The party has just entered [[Phandalin]], quick recap first.

*"As the last traces of daylight fade, you enter the town of [[Phandalin]]. The air smells faintly of earth and smoke, the roads worn from wagon wheels but strangely empty. The few townsfolk you pass glance up, hopeful, wary and desperate."*

The party finds the town to be empty and the people to be miserable, but hopeful that they might solve their problems.

*"One saddened man you pass looks up, his face turns exited, and loudly shouts ‘The adventurers are here!’ and runs off, telling more people. Within moments, faces peek from windows, hope filling their faces"*

They are told to enter [[Stonehill Inn]], where they can rest for a night

*“Soon the guards slow, one gestures to a building, ‘this is [[Stonehill Inn]], they will let you stay here for the night.’ He hesitates but quickly adds ‘Thank you again for helping us, if you manage to finally fix our goblin issue, then I’m sure just like us, the whole town will be in debt to you.’”*

They meet the town’s mayor, [[Harbin Wester]], who believes them to be the hired adventurers.

*“As you enter [[Stonehill Inn|the Inn]], a nervous man spots and runs up to you, he starts wiping sweat from his brow while trying to hide his tiredness ‘Uh hello, are you the adventurers we hired to help us?’”*

The mayor finds out that they are not the promised adventurers, but are adventurers none the less.

*“He seems very disappointed by this, however, after a few seconds he glances up at you in hope, ‘But, judging by your clothes to your weapons, you are adventurers, right?‘“*

Finding out they are adventurers, he tries to recruit them to help out the town for a short while, and then they can go on their way.

*“Almost immediately his eyes are filled with more hope than you have ever see before, ‘Thank [[Chauntea]]! We’ve got a bit of an issue that we need some adventurers to handle, can you help us? We will of course pay you handsomely, and I’ll let you stay here free of charge while you are working.’”*

The party presumably accept, and he says he’ll tell them the details in the morning.

*“‘Well thank you, I’ll tell you the details in the morning, it’s getting late. Oh and before I forget I’m [[Harbin Wester]], I am the town master of [[Phandalin]].’ He starts walking off, but turns around and says ‘Right, you need a room, talk to the barkeeper, [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]], tell him I sent you, if he asks tells him he owes me one’ He then leaves the building, exhaling in relief once outside.”*

Next the players can interact with the NPCs in the bar room or go straight to their rooms to sleep.

Key NPCs to introduce subtly:
	- Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]]: Nervous, sweating through his collar, pretending control. He thanks the party profusely, insists [[Phandalin]] “has things handled,” but his eyes dart to the window every few sentences.
    - [[Kara Quill]]: A representative from [[Acquisitions Incorporated|Acq Inc]]. Clean, composed, and far too calm for the chaos around her. She congratulates the party on “their first successful operation”even if they’ve never heard of [[Acquisitions Incorporated|Acq Inc]]. before.
    - [[Toblen Stonehill]]: The bar keeper, relatively composed, and very willing to tell the party any gossip from [[Stonehill Inn|the Inn]]’s common room.
    - [[Sharna Quirstiron]]: Quite nervous about the interruptions of the trade routes to [[Stonehaven]], causing her to be losing a lot of money, but is too drunk to talk too seriously.
    - [[Qelline Alderleaf]]: Angry, stressed, tells the party about the goblins that have been ransacking her fields (if they ask why she isn’t watching them, [[Carp Alderleaf|her son]] is).

The night closes with one of the PCs having a dream of [[The Merge]], seeing purple cracks in the sky from now on whilst they are in [[Phandalin]].

*“As you drift into a slumber you enter the dreamscape, {INSERT DESIRE TO DO WITH BACKSTORY}, as you are enjoying your dream, the setting suddenly shifts to the middle of [[Phandalin]], but it seems different to today, the town seems a lot more populated, but, townsfolk are running indoors and screaming about the end of the world. You look up to see the sky spilt by amethyst lights down the middle, cracks appear across it, pulsing and rapidly widening. Looking into the crack, you see glimpses of different worlds, among them you can spot a [[Llangranog|small beach town with modest homes]], an [[London|industrial city with tall buildings and a clock tower in the centre]], and finally a vast, silent desert broken only by a singular temple. A deep hum presses into your mind, something immense, ancient, and far beyond your understanding. The town slowly vanishes. The cracked worlds blur. All that remains is the rhythmic pounding of the cracks in the sky. Suddenly it goes quiet. You blink once and awaken from your slumber, you have returned back to reality.”*
