**“Heroes of Phandalin”**

Setting: Phandalin, evening celebration

- The town holds a small festival or feast in the party’s honour; banners, cheers, and free drinks.
- NPCs the party helped earlier (the merchants, innkeeper, guards) show up to thank them.
- Harbin publicly recognizes them, maybe with a small badge or medallion marking them as official protectors.
- Level-up moment: symbolically and mechanically earned.
- Amid celebration, a new threat rumour circulates:
	- A white dragon has been sighted over the northern mountains. 
	- Stonehaven caravans report frost damage and strange magical readings.
    - A guild representative offers to sponsor the party for this “higher-profile contract.”
